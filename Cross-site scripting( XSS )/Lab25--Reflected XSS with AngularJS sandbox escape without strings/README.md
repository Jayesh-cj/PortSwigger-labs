# Lab-25: [Reflected XSS with AngularJS sandbox escape without strings](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/client-side-template-injection/lab-angular-sandbox-escape-without-strings)

This lab uses AngularJS in an unusual way where the ``` $eval ``` function is not available and you will be unable to use any strings in AngularJS.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that escapes the sandbox and executes the ``` alert ``` function without using the ``` $eval ``` function.



## Solution
- Append the following payload to the **URL** and make the request.
```
?search=1&toString().constructor.prototype.charAt%3d[].join;[1]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)=1
```

The exploit uses ``` toString() ``` to create a string without using quotes. It then gets the String prototype and overwrites the ``` charAt ``` function for every string. This effectively breaks the AngularJS sandbox. Next, an array is passed to the ``` orderBy ``` filter. We then set the argument for the filter by again using ``` toString() ``` to create a string and the String constructor property. Finally, we use the ``` fromCharCode ``` method generate our payload by converting character codes into the string ``` x=alert(1) ```. Because the ``` charAt ``` function has been overwritten, AngularJS will allow this code.
